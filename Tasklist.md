Ryan - Determine optimal amount of vector space reduction that can be achieved without losing anything above minimal classification data.
Ryan - Decide methodology of dimension reduction and document rationale behind choice.
Ryan - Actual implementation of dimension reduction.
Ryan - Compare application results when reducing to different numbers of dimensions.
Ryan - Document if the optimal number of dimensions is relatively consistent across different document embedding techniques.
