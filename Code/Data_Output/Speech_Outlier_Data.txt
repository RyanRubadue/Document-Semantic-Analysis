1: 0.5652295: To the Senate of the United States: I transmit to the Senate, for consideration with a view to its ratification, an additional article to the treaty of the 29th of November last, for the annexation of the Dominican Republic to the United States, stipulating for an extension of the time for exchanging the ratifications thereof, signed in this city on the 14th instant, by the plenipotentiaries of the parties. 0.61827224: It was my intention to have also negotiated with the plenipotentiary of San Domingo amendments to the treaty of annexation to obviate objections which may be urged against the treaty as it is now worded; but on reflection I deem it better to submit to the Senate the propriety of their amending the treaty as follows: First, to specify that the obligations of this Government shall not exceed the $ 1,500,000 stipulated in the treaty; secondly, to determine the manner of appointing the agents to receive and disburse the same; thirdly, to determine the class of creditors who shall take precedence in the settlement of their claims; and, finally, to insert such amendments as may suggest themselves to the minds of Senators to carry out in good faith the conditions of the treaty submitted to the Senate of the United States in January last, according to the spirit and intent of that treaty. 0.59439176: From the most reliable information I can obtain, the sum specified in the treaty will pay every just claim against the Republic of San Domingo and leave a balance sufficient to carry on a Territorial government until such time as new laws for providing a Territorial revenue can be enacted and put in force. 0.5340016: I feel an unusual anxiety for the ratification of this treaty, because I believe it will redound greatly to the glory of the two countries interested, to civilization, and to the extirpation of the institution of slavery. 0.55137813: The doctrine promulgated by President Monroe has been adhered to by all political parties, and I now deem it proper to assert the equally important principle that hereafter no territory on this continent shall be regarded as subject of transfer to a European power. 0.6006006: The Government of San Domingo has voluntarily sought this annexation. 0.49949512: It is a weak power, numbering probably less than 120,000 souls, and yet possessing one of the richest territories under the sun, capable of supporting a population of 10,000,000 people in luxury. 0.53528976: The people of San Domingo are not capable of maintaining themselves in their present condition, and must look for outside support. 0.47769982: They yearn for the protection of our free institutions and laws, our progress and civilization. 0.48621383: Shall we refuse them? 0.5492039: I have information which I believe reliable that a European power stands ready now to offer $ 2,000,000 for the possession of Samana Bay alone. 0.54501235: If refused by us, with what grace can we prevent a foreign power from attempting to secure the prize? 0.6110242: The acquisition of San Domingo is desirable because of its geographical position. 0.5556599: It commands the entrance to the Caribbean Sea and the Isthmus transit of commerce. 0.52245104: It possesses the richest soil, best and most capacious harbors, most salubrious climate, and the most valuable products of the forests, mine, and soil of any of the West India Islands. 0.60323846: Its possession by us will in a few years build up a coastwise commerce of immense magnitude, which will go far toward restoring to us our lost merchant marine. 0.57715404: It will give to us those articles which we consume so largely and do not produce, thus equalizing our exports and imports. 0.57497853: In case of foreign war it will give us command of all the islands referred to, and thus prevent an enemy from ever again possessing himself of rendezvous upon our very coast. 0.5620895: At present our coast trade between the States bordering on the Atlantic and those bordering on the Gulf of Mexico is cut into by the Bahamas and the Antilles. 0.5288188: Twice we must, as it were, pass through foreign countries to get by sea from Georgia to the west coast of Florida. 0.59251434: San Domingo, with a stable government, under which her immense resources can be developed, will give remunerative wages to tens of thousands of laborers not now on the island. 0.5296454: This labor will take advantage of every available means of transportation to abandon the adjacent islands and seek the blessings of freedom and its sequence each inhabitant receiving the reward of his own labor. 0.5546043: Porto Rico and Cuba will have to abolish slavery, as a measure of self preservation to retain their laborers. 0.52153206: San Domingo will become a large consumer of the products of Northern farms and manufactories. 0.56031007: The cheap rate at which her citizens can be furnished with food, tools, and machinery will make it necessary that the contiguous islands should have the same advantages in order to compete in the production of sugar, coffee, tobacco, tropical fruits, etc. 0.49688464: This will open to us a still wider market for our products. 0.55127746: The production of our own supply of these articles will cut off more than one hundred millions of our annual imports, besides largely increasing our exports. 0.53342026: With such a picture it is easy to see how our large debt abroad is ultimately to be extinguished. 0.5492301: With a balance of trade against us ( including interest on bonds held by foreigners and money spent by our citizens traveling in foreign lands ) equal to the entire yield of the precious metals in this country, it is not so easy to see how this result is to be otherwise accomplished. 0.6445461: The acquisition of San Domingo is an adherence to the “Monroe doctrine;” it is a measure of national protection; it is asserting our just claim to a controlling influence over the great commercial traffic soon to flow from east to west by the way of the Isthmus of Darien; it is to build up our merchant marine; it is to furnish new markets for the products of our farms, shops, and manufactories; it is to make slavery insupportable in Cuba and Porto Rico at once and ultimately so in Brazil; it is to settle the unhappy condition of Cuba, and end an exterminating conflict; it is to provide honest means of paying our honest debts, without overtaxing the people; it is to furnish our citizens with the necessaries of everyday life at cheaper rates than ever before; and it is, in fine, a rapid stride toward that greatness which the intelligence, industry, and enterprise of the citizens of the United States entitle this country to assume among nations

9 0.53342026: With such a picture it is easy to see how our large debt abroad is ultimately to be extinguished.
10 0.5340016: I feel an unusual anxiety for the ratification of this treaty, because I believe it will redound greatly to the glory of the two countries interested, to civilization, and to the extirpation of the institution of slavery.
11 0.53528976: The people of San Domingo are not capable of maintaining themselves in their present condition, and must look for outside support.
12 0.54501235: If refused by us, with what grace can we prevent a foreign power from attempting to secure the prize?
13 0.5492039: I have information which I believe reliable that a European power stands ready now to offer $ 2,000,000 for the possession of Samana Bay alone.
14 0.5492301: With a balance of trade against us ( including interest on bonds held by foreigners and money spent by our citizens traveling in foreign lands ) equal to the entire yield of the precious metals in this country, it is not so easy to see how this result is to be otherwise accomplished.
15 0.55127746: The production of our own supply of these articles will cut off more than one hundred millions of our annual imports, besides largely increasing our exports.
16 0.55137813: The doctrine promulgated by President Monroe has been adhered to by all political parties, and I now deem it proper to assert the equally important principle that hereafter no territory on this continent shall be regarded as subject of transfer to a European power.
17 0.5546043: Porto Rico and Cuba will have to abolish slavery, as a measure of self preservation to retain their laborers.
18 0.5556599: It commands the entrance to the Caribbean Sea and the Isthmus transit of commerce.
19 0.56031007: The cheap rate at which her citizens can be furnished with food, tools, and machinery will make it necessary that the contiguous islands should have the same advantages in order to compete in the production of sugar, coffee, tobacco, tropical fruits, etc.
20 0.5620895: At present our coast trade between the States bordering on the Atlantic and those bordering on the Gulf of Mexico is cut into by the Bahamas and the Antilles.



2: 0.5565811: To the House of Representatives: After a very careful consideration of the House bill No. 0.664991: 1093, entitled “An act to authorize the coinage of the standard silver dollar and to restore its legal-tender character,” I feel compelled to return it to the House of Representatives, in which it originated, with my objections to its passage. 0.6858258: Holding the opinion, which I expressed in my annual message, that “neither the interests of the Government nor of the people of the United States would be promoted by disparaging silver as one of the two precious metals which furnish the coinage of the world, and that legislation which looks to maintaining the volume of intrinsic money to as full a measure of both metals as their relative commercial values will permit would be neither unjust nor inexpedient,” it has been my earnest desire to concur with Congress in the adoption of such measures to increase the silver coinage of the country as would not impair the obligation of contracts, either public or private, nor injuriously affect the public credit. 0.5611352: It is only upon the conviction that this bill does not meet these essential requirements that I feel it my duty to withhold from it my approval. 0.5841973: My present official duty as to this bill permits only an attention to the specific objections to its passage which seem to me so important as to justify me in asking from the wisdom and duty of Congress that further consideration of the bill for which the Constitution has in such cases provided. 0.7012229: The bill provides for the coinage of silver dollars of the weight of 412 1/2 grains each, of standard silver, to be a legal tender at their nominal value for all debts and dues, public and private, except where otherwise expressly stipulated in the contract. 0.6072728: It is well known that the market value of that number of grains of standard silver during the post year has been from 90 to 92 cents as compared with the standard gold dollar. 0.6912204: Thus the silver dollar authorized by this bill is worth 8 to 10 per cent less than it purports to be worth, and is made a legal tender for debts contracted when the law did not recognize such coins as lawful money. 0.6405796: The right to pay duties in silver or in certificates for silver deposits will, when they are issued in sufficient amount to circulate, put an end to the receipt of revenue in gold, and thus compel the payment of silver for both the principal and interest of the public debt. 0.66833824: One billion one hundred and forty-three million four hundred and ninety-three thousand four hundred dollars of the bonded debt now outstanding was issued prior to February, 1873, when the silver dollar was unknown in circulation in this country, and was only a convenient form of silver bullion for exportation; $ 583,440,350 of the funded debt has been issued since February, 1873, when gold alone was the coin for which the bonds were sold, and gold alone was the coin in which both parties to the contract understood that the bonds would be paid. 0.56054485: These bonds entered into the markets of the world. 0.6186163: They were paid for in gold when silver had greatly depreciated, and when no one would have bought them if it had been understood that they would be paid in silver. 0.5961413: The sum of $ 225,000,000 of these bonds has been sold during my Administration for gold coin, and the United States received the benefit of these sales by a reduction of the rate of interest to 4 per cent. 0.6174923: During the progress of these sales a doubt was suggested as to the coin in which payment of these bonds would be made. 0.6800727: The public announcement was thereupon authorized that it was “not to be anticipated that any future legislation of Congress or any action of any department of the Government would sanction or tolerate the redemption of the principal of these bonds or the payment of the interest thereon in coin of less value than the coin authorized by law at the time of the issue of the bonds, being the coin exacted by the Government in exchange for the same.” In view of these facts it will be justly regarded as a grave breach of the public faith to undertake to pay these bonds, principal or interest, in silver coin worth in the market less than the coin received for them. 0.6898078: It is said that the silver dollar made a legal tender by this bill will under its operation be equivalent in value to the gold dollar. 0.6343611: Many supporters of the bill believe this, and would not justify an attempt to pay debts, either public or private, in coin of inferior value to the money of the world. 0.62994874: The capital defect of the bill is that it contains no provision protecting from its operation preexisting debts in case the coinage which it creates shall continue to be of less value than that which was the sole legal tender when they were contracted. 0.72666335: If it is now proposed, for the purpose of taking advantage of the depreciation of silver in the payment of debts, to coin and make a legal lender a silver dollar of less commercial value than any dollar, whether of gold or paper, which is now lawful money in this country, such measure, it will hardly be questioned, will, in the judgment of mankind, be an act of bad faith. 0.71391857: As to all debts heretofore contracted, the silver dollar should be made a legal tender only at its market value. 0.5325826: The standard of value should not be changed without the consent of both parties to the contract. 0.5004823: National promises should be kept with unflinching fidelity. 0.5641415: There is no power to compel a nation to pay its just debts. 0.5109902: Its credit depends on its honor. 0.5812051: The nation owes what it has led or allowed its creditors to expect. 0.5572909: I can not approve a bill which in my judgment authorizes the violation of sacred obligations. 0.49695635: The obligation of the public faith transcends all questions of profit or public advantage. 0.544622: Its unquestionable maintenance is the dictate as well of the highest expediency as of the most necessary duty, and should ever be carefully guarded by the Executive, by Congress, and by the people. 0.6829171: It is my firm conviction that if the country is to be benefited by a silver coinage it can be done only by the issue of silver dollars of full value, which will defraud no man. 0.6244984: A currency worth less than it purports to be worth will in the end defraud not only creditors, but all who are engaged in legitimate business, and none more surely than those who are dependent on their daily labor for their daily bread

1 0.49695635: The obligation of the public faith transcends all questions of profit or public advantage.
2 0.5004823: National promises should be kept with unflinching fidelity.
3 0.5109902: Its credit depends on its honor.
4 0.5325826: The standard of value should not be changed without the consent of both parties to the contract.
5 0.544622: Its unquestionable maintenance is the dictate as well of the highest expediency as of the most necessary duty, and should ever be carefully guarded by the Executive, by Congress, and by the people.
6 0.5565811: To the House of Representatives: After a very careful consideration of the House bill No.
7 0.5572909: I can not approve a bill which in my judgment authorizes the violation of sacred obligations.
8 0.56054485: These bonds entered into the markets of the world.
9 0.5611352: It is only upon the conviction that this bill does not meet these essential requirements that I feel it my duty to withhold from it my approval.
10 0.5641415: There is no power to compel a nation to pay its just debts.
11 0.5812051: The nation owes what it has led or allowed its creditors to expect.
12 0.5841973: My present official duty as to this bill permits only an attention to the specific objections to its passage which seem to me so important as to justify me in asking from the wisdom and duty of Congress that further consideration of the bill for which the Constitution has in such cases provided.
13 0.5961413: The sum of $ 225,000,000 of these bonds has been sold during my Administration for gold coin, and the United States received the benefit of these sales by a reduction of the rate of interest to 4 per cent.
14 0.6072728: It is well known that the market value of that number of grains of standard silver during the post year has been from 90 to 92 cents as compared with the standard gold dollar.
15 0.6174923: During the progress of these sales a doubt was suggested as to the coin in which payment of these bonds would be made.
16 0.6186163: They were paid for in gold when silver had greatly depreciated, and when no one would have bought them if it had been understood that they would be paid in silver.
17 0.6244984: A currency worth less than it purports to be worth will in the end defraud not only creditors, but all who are engaged in legitimate business, and none more surely than those who are dependent on their daily labor for their daily bread
18 0.62994874: The capital defect of the bill is that it contains no provision protecting from its operation preexisting debts in case the coinage which it creates shall continue to be of less value than that which was the sole legal tender when they were contracted.
19 0.6343611: Many supporters of the bill believe this, and would not justify an attempt to pay debts, either public or private, in coin of inferior value to the money of the world.
20 0.6405796: The right to pay duties in silver or in certificates for silver deposits will, when they are issued in sufficient amount to circulate, put an end to the receipt of revenue in gold, and thus compel the payment of silver for both the principal and interest of the public debt.



3: 0.6409707: To the Congress: In my annual message addressed to the Congress on the 3d instant I called attention to the pending boundary controversy between Great Britain and the Republic of Venezuela and recited the substance of a representation made by this Government to Her Britannic Majesty ' s Government suggesting reasons why such dispute should be submitted to arbitration for settlement and inquiring whether it would be so submitted. 0.609782: The answer of the British Government, which was then awaited, has since been received, and, together with the dispatch to which it is a reply, is hereto appended. 0.5727542: Such reply is embodied in two communications addressed by the British prime minister to Sir Julian Pauncefote, the British ambassador at this capital. 0.7267362: It will be seen that one of these communications is devoted exclusively to observations upon the Monroe doctrine, and claims that in the present instance a new and strange extension and development of this doctrine is insisted on by the United States; that the reasons justifying an appeal to the doctrine enunciated by President Monroe are generally inapplicable “to the state of things in which we live at the present day,” and especially inapplicable to a controversy involving the boundary line between Great Britain and Venezuela. 0.63660574: Without attempting extended argument in reply to these positions, it may not be amiss to suggest that the doctrine upon which we stand is strong and sound, because its enforcement is important to our peace and safety as a nation and is essential to the integrity of our free institutions and the tranquil maintenance of our distinctive form of government. 0.5404236: It was intended to apply to every stage of our national life and can not become obsolete while our Republic endures. 0.70224774: If the balance of power is justly a cause for jealous anxiety among the Governments of the Old World and a subject for our absolute noninterference, none the less is an observance of the Monroe doctrine of vital concern to our people and their Government. 0.6154615: Assuming, therefore, that we may properly insist upon this doctrine without regard to “the state of things in which we live” or any changed conditions here or elsewhere, it is not apparent why its application may not be invoked in the present controversy. 0.6185983: If a European power by an extension of its boundaries takes possession of the territory of one of our neighboring Republics against its will and in derogation of its rights, it is difficult to see why to that extent such European power does not thereby attempt to extend its system of government to that portion of this continent which is thus taken. 0.6372475: This is the precise action which President Monroe declared to be “dangerous to our peace and safety,” and it can make no difference whether the European system is extended by an advance of frontier or otherwise. 0.72635937: It is also suggested in the British reply that we should not seek to apply the Monroe doctrine to the pending dispute because it does not embody any principle of international law which “is rounded on the general consent of nations,” and that “no statesman, however eminent, and no nation, however powerful, are competent to insert into the code of international law a novel principle which was never recognized before and which has not since been accepted by the government of any other country.” Practically the principle for which we contend has peculiar, if not exclusive, relation to the United States. 0.70041597: It may not have been admitted in so many words to the code of international law, but since in international councils every nation is entitled to the rights belonging to it, if the enforcement of the Monroe doctrine is something we may justly claim it has its place in the code of international law as certainly and as securely as if it were specifically mentioned; and when the United States is a suitor before the high tribunal that administers international law the question to be determined is whether or not we present claims which the justice of that code of law can find to be right and valid. 0.63884443: The Monroe doctrine finds its recognition in those principles of international law which are based upon the theory that every nation shall have its rights protected and its just claims enforced. 0.5723679: Of course this Government is entirely confident that under the sanction of this doctrine we have clear rights and undoubted claims. 0.5286719: Nor is this ignored in the British reply. 0.66150874: The prime minister, while not admitting that the Monroe doctrine is applicable to present conditions, states: In declaring that the United States would resist any such enterprise if it was contemplated, President Monroe adopted a policy which received the entire sympathy of the English Government of that date. 0.6553186: He further declares: Though the language of President Monroe is directed to the attainment of objects which most Englishmen would agree to be salutary, it is impossible to admit that they have been inscribed By any adequate authority in the code of international law. 0.69744956: Again he says: They ( Her Majesty's Government ) fully concur with the view which president Monroe apparently entertained, that any disturbance of the existing territorial distribution in that hemisphere by any fresh acquisitions on the part of any European State would be a highly inexpedient change. 0.6660008: In the belief that the doctrine for which we contend was clear and definite, that it was rounded upon substantial considerations and involved our safety and welfare, that it was fully applicable to our present conditions and to the state of the world's progress, and that it was directly related to the pending controversy, and without any conviction as to the final merits of the dispute, but anxious to learn in a satisfactory and conclusive manner whether Great Britain sought under a claim of boundary to extend her possessions on this continent without right, or whether she merely sought possession of territory fairly included within her lines of ownership, this Government proposed to the Government of Great Britain a resort to arbitration as the proper means of settling the question, to the end that a vexatious boundary dispute between the two contestants might be determined and our exact standing and relation in respect to the controversy might be made clear. 0.62391925: It will be seen from the correspondence herewith submitted that this proposition has been declined by the British Government upon grounds which in the circumstances seem to me to be far from satisfactory. 0.5918516: It is deeply disappointing that such an appeal, actuated by the most friendly feelings toward both nations directly concerned, addressed to the sense of justice and to the magnanimity of one of the great powers of the world, and touching its relations to one comparatively weak and small, should have produced no better results. 0.59032947: The course to be pursued by this Government in view of the present condition does not appear to admit of serious doubt. 0.61943126: Having labored faithfully for many years to induce Great Britain to submit this dispute to impartial arbitration, and having been now finally apprised of her refusal to do so, nothing remains but to accept the situation, to recognize its plain requirements, and deal with it accordingly. 0.66343427: Great Britain's present proposition has never thus far been regarded as admissible by Venezuela, though any adjustment of the boundary which that country may deem for her advantage and may enter into of her own free will can not of course be objected to by the United States. 0.6302929: Assuming, however, that the attitude of Venezuela will remain unchanged, the dispute has reached such a stage as to make it now incumbent upon the United States to take measures to determine with sufficient certainty for its justification what is the true divisional line between the Republic of Venezuela and British Guiana. 0.5379544: The inquiry to that end should of course be conducted carefully and judicially, and due weight should be given to all available evidence, records, and facts in support of the claims of both parties. 0.518714: In order that such an examination should be prosecuted in a thorough and satisfactory manner, I suggest that the Congress make an adequate appropriation for the expenses of a commission, to be appointed by the Executive, who shall make the necessary investigation and report upon the matter with the least possible delay. 0.6204105: When such report is made and accepted it will, in my opinion, be the duty of the United States to resist by every means in its power, as a willful aggression upon its rights and interests, the appropriation by Great Britain of any lands or the exercise of governmental jurisdiction over any territory which after investigation we have determined of right belongs to Venezuela. 0.46700016: In making these recommendations I am fully alive to the responsibility incurred and keenly realize all the consequences that may follow. 0.61245054: I am, nevertheless, firm in my conviction that while it is a grievous thing to contemplate the two great English-speaking peoples of the world as being otherwise than friendly competitors in the onward march of civilization and strenuous and worthy rivals in all the arts of peace, there is no calamity which a great nation can invite which equals that which follows a supine submission to wrong and injustice and the consequent loss of national self respect and honor, beneath which are shielded and defended a people's safety and greatness

13 0.6185983: If a European power by an extension of its boundaries takes possession of the territory of one of our neighboring Republics against its will and in derogation of its rights, it is difficult to see why to that extent such European power does not thereby attempt to extend its system of government to that portion of this continent which is thus taken.

18 0.63660574: Without attempting extended argument in reply to these positions, it may not be amiss to suggest that the doctrine upon which we stand is strong and sound, because its enforcement is important to our peace and safety as a nation and is essential to the integrity of our free institutions and the tranquil maintenance of our distinctive form of government.
19 0.6372475: This is the precise action which President Monroe declared to be “dangerous to our peace and safety,” and it can make no difference whether the European system is extended by an advance of frontier or otherwise.
20 0.63884443: The Monroe doctrine finds its recognition in those principles of international law which are based upon the theory that every nation shall have its rights protected and its just claims enforced.



4: 0.58039564: To the Congress of the United States: Regretting the necessity which has required me to call you together, I feel that your assembling in extraordinary session is indispensable because of the condition in which we find the revenues of the Government. 0.56891817: It is conceded that its current expenditures are greater than its receipts, and that such a condition has existed for now more than three years. 0.5682754: With unlimited means at our command, we are presenting the remarkable spectacle of increasing our public debt by borrowing money to meet the ordinary outlays incident upon even an economical and prudent administration of the Government. 0.5528491: An examination of the subject discloses this fact in every detail and leads inevitably to the conclusion that the condition of the revenue which allows it is unjustifiable and should be corrected. 0.75541: We find by the reports of the Secretary of the Treasury that the revenues for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1892, from all sources were $ 425,868,260.22, and the expenditures for all purposes were $ 415,953,806.56, leaving an excess of receipts over expenditures of $ 9,914,453.66. 0.60413027: During that fiscal year $ 40,570,467.98 were paid upon the public debt, which had been reduced since March 1, 1889, $ 259,076,890, and the annual interest charge decreased $ 11,684,576.60. 0.7782705: The receipts of the Government from all sources during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1893, amounted to $ 461,716,561.94, and its expenditures to $ 459,374,887.65, showing an excess of receipts over expenditures of $ 2,341,674.29. 0.648509: Since that time the receipts of no fiscal year, and with but few exceptions of no month of any fiscal year, have exceeded the expenditures. 0.77335125: The receipts of the Government, from all sources, during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1894, were $ 372,802,498.29, and its expenditures $ 442,605,758.87, leaving a deficit, the first since the resumption of specie payments, of $ 69,803,260.58. 0.64998573: Notwithstanding there was a decrease of $ 16,769,128.78 in the ordinary expenses of the Government, as compared with the previous fiscal year, its income was still not sufficient to provide for its daily necessities, and the gold reserve in the Treasury for the redemption of greenbacks was drawn upon to meet them. 0.57824415: But this did not suffice, and the Government then resorted to loans to replenish the reserve. 0.6002005: In February, 1894, $ 50,000,000 in bonds were issued, and in November following a second issue of $ 50,000,000 was deemed necessary. 0.6290449: The sum of $ 117,171,795 was realized by the sale of these bonds, but the reserve was steadily decreased until, on February 8, 1895, a third sale of $ 62,315,400 in bonds, for $ 65,116,244, was announced to Congress. 0.77336216: The receipts of the Government for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1895, were $ 390,373,203.30, and the expenditures $ 433,178,426.48, showing a deficit of $ 42,805,223.18. 0.6144958: A further loan of $ 100,000,000 was negotiated by the Government in February, 1896, the sale netting $ 1,166,246, and swelling the aggregate of bonds issued within three years to $ 262,315,400. 0.75319356: For the fiscal year ending June 30, 1896, the revenues of the Government from all sources amounted to $ 409,475,408.78, while its expenditures were $ 434,678,654.48, or an excess of expenditures over receipts of $ 25,203,245.70. 0.7099106: In other words, the total receipts for the three fiscal years ending June 30, 1896, were insufficient by $ 137,811,729.46 to meet the total expenditures. 0.44328094: Nor has this condition since improved. 0.7249925: For the first half of the present fiscal year, the receipts of the Government, exclusive of postal revenues, were $ 157,507,603.76, and its expenditures, exclusive of postal service, $ 195,410,000.22, or an excess of expenditures over receipts of $ 37,902,396.46. 0.6867604: In January of this year, the receipts, exclusive of postal revenues, were $ 24,316,994.05, and the expenditures, exclusive of postal service, $ 30,269,389.29, a deficit of $ 5,952,395.24 for the month. 0.73436797: In February of this year, the receipts, exclusive of postal revenues, were $ 24,400,997.38, and expenditures, exclusive of postal service, $ 28,796,056.66, a deficit of $ 4,395,059.28; or a total deficiency of $ 186,061,580.44 for the three years and eight months ending March 1, 1897. 0.6327859: Not only are we without a surplus in the Treasury, but with an increase in the public debt there has been a corresponding increase in the annual interest charge, from $ 22,893,883.20 in 1892, the lowest of any year since 1862, to $ 34,387,297.60 in 1896, or an increase of $ 11,493,414.40. 0.6117038: It may be urged that even if the revenues of the Government had been sufficient to meet all its ordinary expenses during the past three years, the gold reserve would still have been insufficient to meet the demands upon it, and that bonds would necessarily have been issued for its repletion. 0.5418734: Be this as it may, it is clearly manifest, without denying or affirming the correctness of such a conclusion, that the debt would have been decreased in at least the amount of the deficiency, and business confidence immeasurably strengthened throughout the country. 0.5144053: Congress should promptly correct the existing condition. 0.590498: Ample revenues must be supplied not only for the ordinary expenses of the Government, but for the prompt payment of liberal pensions and the liquidation of the principal and interest of the public debt. 0.54863954: In raising revenue, duties should be so levied upon foreign products as to preserve the home market, so far as possible, to our own producers; to revive and increase manufactures; to relieve and encourage agriculture; to increase our domestic and foreign commerce; to aid and develop mining and building; and to render to labor in every field of useful occupation the liberal wages and adequate rewards to which skill and industry are justly entitled. 0.5386587: The necessity of the passage of a tariff law which shall provide ample revenue, need not be further urged. 0.5349724: The imperative demand of the hour is the prompt enactment of such a measure, and to this object I earnestly recommend that Congress shall make every endeavor. 0.59935486: Before other business is transacted, let us first provide sufficient revenue to faithfully administer the Government without the contracting of further debt, or the continued disturbance of our finances

1 0.44328094: Nor has this condition since improved.
2 0.5144053: Congress should promptly correct the existing condition.
3 0.5349724: The imperative demand of the hour is the prompt enactment of such a measure, and to this object I earnestly recommend that Congress shall make every endeavor.
4 0.5386587: The necessity of the passage of a tariff law which shall provide ample revenue, need not be further urged.
5 0.5418734: Be this as it may, it is clearly manifest, without denying or affirming the correctness of such a conclusion, that the debt would have been decreased in at least the amount of the deficiency, and business confidence immeasurably strengthened throughout the country.
6 0.54863954: In raising revenue, duties should be so levied upon foreign products as to preserve the home market, so far as possible, to our own producers; to revive and increase manufactures; to relieve and encourage agriculture; to increase our domestic and foreign commerce; to aid and develop mining and building; and to render to labor in every field of useful occupation the liberal wages and adequate rewards to which skill and industry are justly entitled.
7 0.5528491: An examination of the subject discloses this fact in every detail and leads inevitably to the conclusion that the condition of the revenue which allows it is unjustifiable and should be corrected.
8 0.5682754: With unlimited means at our command, we are presenting the remarkable spectacle of increasing our public debt by borrowing money to meet the ordinary outlays incident upon even an economical and prudent administration of the Government.
9 0.56891817: It is conceded that its current expenditures are greater than its receipts, and that such a condition has existed for now more than three years.
10 0.57824415: But this did not suffice, and the Government then resorted to loans to replenish the reserve.
11 0.58039564: To the Congress of the United States: Regretting the necessity which has required me to call you together, I feel that your assembling in extraordinary session is indispensable because of the condition in which we find the revenues of the Government.
12 0.590498: Ample revenues must be supplied not only for the ordinary expenses of the Government, but for the prompt payment of liberal pensions and the liquidation of the principal and interest of the public debt.
13 0.59935486: Before other business is transacted, let us first provide sufficient revenue to faithfully administer the Government without the contracting of further debt, or the continued disturbance of our finances
14 0.6002005: In February, 1894, $ 50,000,000 in bonds were issued, and in November following a second issue of $ 50,000,000 was deemed necessary.
15 0.60413027: During that fiscal year $ 40,570,467.98 were paid upon the public debt, which had been reduced since March 1, 1889, $ 259,076,890, and the annual interest charge decreased $ 11,684,576.60.
16 0.6117038: It may be urged that even if the revenues of the Government had been sufficient to meet all its ordinary expenses during the past three years, the gold reserve would still have been insufficient to meet the demands upon it, and that bonds would necessarily have been issued for its repletion.
17 0.6144958: A further loan of $ 100,000,000 was negotiated by the Government in February, 1896, the sale netting $ 1,166,246, and swelling the aggregate of bonds issued within three years to $ 262,315,400.
18 0.6290449: The sum of $ 117,171,795 was realized by the sale of these bonds, but the reserve was steadily decreased until, on February 8, 1895, a third sale of $ 62,315,400 in bonds, for $ 65,116,244, was announced to Congress.
19 0.6327859: Not only are we without a surplus in the Treasury, but with an increase in the public debt there has been a corresponding increase in the annual interest charge, from $ 22,893,883.20 in 1892, the lowest of any year since 1862, to $ 34,387,297.60 in 1896, or an increase of $ 11,493,414.40.
20 0.648509: Since that time the receipts of no fiscal year, and with but few exceptions of no month of any fiscal year, have exceeded the expenditures.



5: 0.59819776: To the Senate and House of Representatives: It is the constitutional duty of the President from time to time to recommend to the consideration of Congress such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient. 0.58952487: In my inaugural address, immediately preceding this present extraordinary session of Congress, I invited attention to the necessity for a revision of the tariff at this session, and stated the principles upon which I thought the revision should be effected. 0.62732977: I referred to the then rapidly increasing deficit, and pointed out the obligation on the part of the framers of the tariff bill to arrange the duty so as to secure an adequate income, and suggested that if it was not possible to do so by import duties, new kinds of taxation must be adopted, and among them I recommended a graduated inheritance tax as correct in principle and as certain and easy of collection. 0.6057519: The House of Representatives has adopted the suggestion and has provided in the bill it passed for the collection of such a tax. 0.65695375: In the Senate the action of its Finance Committee and the course of the debate indicate that it may not agree to this provision, and it is now proposed to make up the deficit by the imposition of a general income tax, in form and substance of almost exactly the same character as that which in the case of Pollock v. Farmers ' Loan and Trust Company ( 157 U. S., 429 ) was held by the Supreme Court to be a direct tax, and therefore not within the power of the Federal Government to impose unless apportioned among the several States according to population. 0.59310263: This new proposal, which I did not discuss in my inaugural addressor in my message at the opening of the present session, makes it appropriate for me to submit to the Congress certain additional recommendations. 0.5782886: The decision of the Supreme Court in the income tax cases deprived the National Government of a power which, by reason of previous decisions of the court, it was generally supposed that Government had. 0.57075226: It is undoubtedly a power the National Government ought to have. 0.49962178: It might be indispensable to the nation's life in great crises. 0.5738237: Although I have not considered a constitutional amendment as necessary to the exercise of certain phases of this power, a mature consideration has satisfied me that an amendment is the only proper course for its establishment to its full extent. 0.6775152: I therefore recommend to the Congress that both Houses, by a two-thirds vote, shall propose an amendment to the Constitution conferring the power to levy an income tax upon the National Government without apportionment among the States in proportion to population. 0.52772164: This course is much to be preferred to the one proposed of reenacting a law once judicially declared to be unconstitutional. 0.55617744: For the Congress to assume that the court will reverse itself, and to enact legislation on such an assumption, will not strengthen popular confidence in the stability of judicial construction of the Constitution. 0.53966284: It is much wiser policy to accept the decision and remedy the defect by amendment in due and regular course. 0.5975109: Again, it is clear that by the enactment of the proposed law, the Congress will not be bringing money into the Treasury to meet the present deficiency, but by putting on the statute book a law already there and never repealed, will simply be suggesting to the executive officers of the Government their possible duty to invoke litigation. 0.5562125: If the court should maintain its former view, no tax would be collected at all. 0.5411757: If it should ultimately reverse itself, still no taxes would have been collected until after protracted delay. 0.5209537: It is said the difficulty and delay in securing the approval of three fourths of the States will destroy all chance of adopting the amendment. 0.622668: Of course, no one can speak with certainty upon this point, but I have become convinced that a great majority of the people of this country are in favor of vesting the National Government with power to levy an income tax, and that they will secure the adoption of the amendment in the States, if proposed to them. 0.59724337: Second, the decision in the Pollock case left power in the National Government to levy an excise tax which accomplishes the same purpose as a corporation income tax, and is free from certain objections urged to the proposed income tax measure. 0.6240366: I therefore recommend an amendment to the tariff bill imposing upon all corporations and joint stock companies for profit, except national banks ( otherwise taxed ), savings banks, and building and loan associations, an excise tax measured by 2 per cent on the net income of such corporations. 0.58762145: This is an excise tax upon the privilege of doing business as an artificial entity and of freedom from a general partnership liability enjoyed by those who own the stock. 0.56479853: I am informed that a 2 per cent tax of this character would bring into the Treasury of the United States not less than $ 25,000,000. 0.60844177: The decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Spreckels Sugar Refining Company against McClain ( 192 U. S., 397 ) seems clearly to establish the principle that such a tax as this is an excise tax upon privilege and not a direct tax on property, and is within the federal power without apportionment according to population. 0.55254817: The tax on net income is preferable to one proportionate to a percentage of the gross receipts, because it is a tax upon success and not failure. 0.5648361: It imposes a burden at the source of the income at a time when the corporation is well able to pay and when collection is easy. 0.58480996: Another merit of this tax is the federal supervision which must be exercised in order to make the law effective over the annual accounts and business transactions of all corporations. 0.5263907: While the faculty of assuming a corporate form has been of the utmost utility in the business world, it is also true that substantially all of the abuses and all of the evils which have aroused the public to the necessity of reform were made possible by the use of this very faculty. 0.5948794: If now, by a perfectly legitimate and effective system of taxation we are incidentally able to possess the Government and the stockholders and the public of the knowledge of the real business transactions and the gains and profits of every corporation in the country, we have made along step toward that supervisory control of corporations which may prevent a further abuse of power. 0.67400366: I recommend, then, first, the adoption of a joint resolution by two-thirds of both Houses proposing to the States an amendment to the Constitution granting to the Federal Government the right to levy and collect an income tax without apportionment among the States according to population, and, second, the enactment, as part of the pending revenue measure, either as a substitute for, or in addition to, the inheritance tax, of an excise tax upon all corporations measured by 2 per cent of their net income

1 0.49962178: It might be indispensable to the nation's life in great crises.
2 0.5209537: It is said the difficulty and delay in securing the approval of three fourths of the States will destroy all chance of adopting the amendment.
3 0.5263907: While the faculty of assuming a corporate form has been of the utmost utility in the business world, it is also true that substantially all of the abuses and all of the evils which have aroused the public to the necessity of reform were made possible by the use of this very faculty.
4 0.52772164: This course is much to be preferred to the one proposed of reenacting a law once judicially declared to be unconstitutional.
5 0.53966284: It is much wiser policy to accept the decision and remedy the defect by amendment in due and regular course.
6 0.5411757: If it should ultimately reverse itself, still no taxes would have been collected until after protracted delay.
7 0.55254817: The tax on net income is preferable to one proportionate to a percentage of the gross receipts, because it is a tax upon success and not failure.
8 0.55617744: For the Congress to assume that the court will reverse itself, and to enact legislation on such an assumption, will not strengthen popular confidence in the stability of judicial construction of the Constitution.
9 0.5562125: If the court should maintain its former view, no tax would be collected at all.
10 0.56479853: I am informed that a 2 per cent tax of this character would bring into the Treasury of the United States not less than $ 25,000,000.
11 0.5648361: It imposes a burden at the source of the income at a time when the corporation is well able to pay and when collection is easy.
12 0.57075226: It is undoubtedly a power the National Government ought to have.
13 0.5738237: Although I have not considered a constitutional amendment as necessary to the exercise of certain phases of this power, a mature consideration has satisfied me that an amendment is the only proper course for its establishment to its full extent.
14 0.5782886: The decision of the Supreme Court in the income tax cases deprived the National Government of a power which, by reason of previous decisions of the court, it was generally supposed that Government had.
15 0.58480996: Another merit of this tax is the federal supervision which must be exercised in order to make the law effective over the annual accounts and business transactions of all corporations.
16 0.58762145: This is an excise tax upon the privilege of doing business as an artificial entity and of freedom from a general partnership liability enjoyed by those who own the stock.
17 0.58952487: In my inaugural address, immediately preceding this present extraordinary session of Congress, I invited attention to the necessity for a revision of the tariff at this session, and stated the principles upon which I thought the revision should be effected.
18 0.59310263: This new proposal, which I did not discuss in my inaugural addressor in my message at the opening of the present session, makes it appropriate for me to submit to the Congress certain additional recommendations.
19 0.5948794: If now, by a perfectly legitimate and effective system of taxation we are incidentally able to possess the Government and the stockholders and the public of the knowledge of the real business transactions and the gains and profits of every corporation in the country, we have made along step toward that supervisory control of corporations which may prevent a further abuse of power.
20 0.59724337: Second, the decision in the Pollock case left power in the National Government to levy an excise tax which accomplishes the same purpose as a corporation income tax, and is free from certain objections urged to the proposed income tax measure.



6: 0.5687284: To the House of Representatives: It is with unaffected regret that I find myself constrained by clear conviction to return this bill ( H.R. 0.5065337: 6060, “An act to regulate the immigration of aliens to and the residence of aliens in the United States” ) without my signature. 0.58576244: Not only do I feel it to be a very serious matter to exercise the power of veto in any case, because it involves opposing the single judgment of the President to the judgment of a majority of both the Houses of the Congress, a step which no man who realizes his own liability to error can take without great hesitation, but also because this particular bill is in so many important respects admirable, well conceived, and desirable. 0.48876628: Its enactment into law would undoubtedly enhance the efficiency and improve the methods of handling the important branch of the public service to which it relates. 0.5612799: But candor and a sense of duty with regard to the responsibility so clearly imposed upon me by the Constitution in matters of legislation leave me no choice but to dissent. 0.5826954: In two particulars of vital consequence this bill embodies a radical departure from the traditional and long established policy of this country, a policy in which our people have conceived the very character of their Government to be expressed, the very mission and spirit of the Nation in respect of its relations to the peoples of the world outside their borders. 0.5877692: It seeks to all but close entirely the gates of asylum which have always been open to those who could find nowhere else the right and opportunity of constitutional agitation for what they conceived to be the natural and inalienable rights of men; and it excludes those to whom the opportunities of elementary education have been denied, without regard to their character, their purposes, or their natural capacity. 0.55948645: Restrictions like these, adopted earlier in our history as a Nation, would very materially have altered the course and cooled the humane ardors of our politics. 0.5418671: The right of political asylum has brought to this country many a man of noble character and elevated purpose who was marked as an outlaw in his own less fortunate land, and who has yet become an ornament to our citizenship and to our public councils. 0.5652218: The children and the compatriots of these illustrious Americans must stand amazed to see the representatives of their Nation now resolved, in the fullness of our national strength and at the maturity of our great institutions, to risk turning such men back from our shores without test of quality or purpose. 0.5414331: It is difficult for me to believe that the full effect of this feature of the bill was realized when it was framed and adopted, and it is impossible for me to assent to it in the form in which it is here cast. 0.5434814: The literacy test and the tests and restrictions which accompany it constitute an even more radical change in the policy of the Nation. 0.53824943: Hitherto we have generously kept our doors open to all who were not unfitted by reason of disease or incapacity for self support or such personal records and antecedents as were likely to make them a menace to our peace and order or to the wholesome and essential relationships of life. 0.54107517: In this bill it is proposed to turn away from tests of character and of quality and impose tests which exclude and restrict; for the new tests here embodied are not tests of quality or of character or of personal fitness, but tests of opportunity. 0.54219663: Those who come seeking opportunity are not to be admitted unless they have already had one of the chief of the opportunities they seek, the opportunity of education. 0.5463417: The object of such provisions is restriction, not selection. 0.5415106: If the people of this country have made up their minds to limit the number of immigrants by arbitrary tests and so reverse the policy of all the generations of Americans that have gone before them, it is their right to do so. 0.50639164: I am their servant and have no license to stand in their way. 0.47102675: But I do not believe that they have. 0.53308237: I respectfully submit that no one can quote their mandate to that effect. 0.53225386: Has any political party ever avowed a policy of restriction in this fundamental matter, gone to the country on it, and been commissioned to control its legislation? 0.58178604: Does this bill rest upon the conscious and universal assent and desire of the American people? 0.4408243: I doubt it. 0.52312124: It is because I doubt it that I make bold to dissent from it. 0.51204485: I am willing to abide by the verdict, but not until it has been rendered. 0.52917206: Let the platforms of parties speak out upon this policy and the people pronounce their wish. 0.5008013: The matter is too fundamental to be settled otherwise. 0.4695753: I have no pride of opinion in this question. 0.538224: I am not foolish enough to profess to know the wishes and ideals of America better than the body of her chosen representatives know them. 0.4849724: I only want instruction direct from those whose fortunes, with ours and all men's, are involved

1 0.4408243: I doubt it.
2 0.4695753: I have no pride of opinion in this question.
3 0.47102675: But I do not believe that they have.
4 0.4849724: I only want instruction direct from those whose fortunes, with ours and all men's, are involved
5 0.48876628: Its enactment into law would undoubtedly enhance the efficiency and improve the methods of handling the important branch of the public service to which it relates.
6 0.5008013: The matter is too fundamental to be settled otherwise.
7 0.50639164: I am their servant and have no license to stand in their way.
8 0.5065337: 6060, “An act to regulate the immigration of aliens to and the residence of aliens in the United States” ) without my signature.
9 0.51204485: I am willing to abide by the verdict, but not until it has been rendered.
10 0.52312124: It is because I doubt it that I make bold to dissent from it.
11 0.52917206: Let the platforms of parties speak out upon this policy and the people pronounce their wish.
12 0.53225386: Has any political party ever avowed a policy of restriction in this fundamental matter, gone to the country on it, and been commissioned to control its legislation?
13 0.53308237: I respectfully submit that no one can quote their mandate to that effect.
14 0.538224: I am not foolish enough to profess to know the wishes and ideals of America better than the body of her chosen representatives know them.
